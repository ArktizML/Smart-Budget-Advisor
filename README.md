# 💰 Smart Budget Advisor

**Smart Budget Advisor** is a personal finance web application built with **Flask** that helps users track expenses, analyze spending patterns, and receive AI-assisted insights — all in a simple, privacy-focused setup using local JSON storage.

The project was designed as a **full-stack portfolio application** with emphasis on:
- clean backend architecture
- correct financial and currency logic
- user data isolation
- realistic, production-style features

## 🚀 Features

### 💸 Expense Management
- Add, edit and delete expenses
- Assign categories and descriptions
- Per-user expense isolation
- Input validation and error handling

### 🌍 Currency Support
- User-selectable default currency (PLN, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- Automatic currency conversion based on real exchange rates
- Exchange rates fetched from a free external API and cached daily
- All expenses internally stored using a base currency to ensure data consistency

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
- Expense overview for the logged-in user
- Filtering by category
- Filtering by date range
- Empty-state handling and safe edge cases
- Bar chart and pie chart visualizations of spending

### 🤖 AI Advisor

  - Key spending insights
  - Basic statistics (average transaction, median transaction)
  - Monthly spending trends
  - Category breakdown
  - Simple anomaly detection
- AI chat assistant for budget-related questions
- Export advisor insights and statistics to a PDF report

### 📁 Data Export
- Export expenses to CSV
- Export charts as image files
- Export full financial analysis to PDF

### 👤 Authentication
- User registration and login
- Secure password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Logout functionality
- User-specific settings and data separation

### ⚙️ User Settings

## 🧠 Technical Overview

### Backend
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Jinja2** templates
- Modular route and logic structure
- JSON-based persistence (no database)

### Currency Conversion
- Real exchange rates fetched from an external API
- Local caching of rates for 24 hours
- Server-side currency conversion (no JavaScript dependency)

### AI Integration
- External AI API used for advisory features
- API keys stored securely via environment variables
- Graceful handling of missing or failed API responses

### Testing
- Unit tests written using **pytest**
- Coverage includes:
  - currency conversion logic
  - application routes and basic app health
